I'm a Software Engineer with a strong foundation in frontend technologies and a growing expertise in backend development. I specialize in building scalable, responsive web applications using React, TypeScript, C#, ASP.NET, and SQL, with deployments on cloud platforms such as Azure.

My background in frontend engineering has shaped a meticulous approach to building user-centric interfaces, from translating design mockups into performant code to optimizing user experiences across devices. Iâ€™ve led the modernization of web applications, streamlined deployment pipelines with Kubernetes on Amazon EKS, and introduced architectural improvements that enhanced maintainability and performance.

More recently, Iâ€™ve been focused on backend development, building RESTful APIs, working with relational databases, and contributing to the design of distributed systems. I enjoy solving complex problems through clean architecture, efficient code, and close collaboration with cross-functional teams.

Passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences, I combine technical execution with a product mindset, backed by hands-on work in UX research, prototyping, and usability testing. My goal is to develop intuitive, robust solutions that deliver genuine value to both users and businesses.
